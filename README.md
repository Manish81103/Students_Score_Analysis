# Students Scores Analysis

This project focuses on analyzing student scores using various data analysis techniques. The primary goal is to clean and preprocess the data, handle missing values and outliers, and then analyze the data to extract meaningful insights. The analysis is performed using Python libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib.

# Data Preprocessing

## Data Cleaning
__Handling Missing Values:__ Missing data is imputed or removed to ensure the dataset is complete and consistent.
We used Measures of central tendency,Random Value imputation and Predictive models for Handling Missing values.


__Outlier Detection:__ Outliers are identified and handled using statistical methods to ensure they do not skew the analysis.
We used Boundary value , IQR and percentile method to handle Outliers.

# Data Analysis
## 1. Descriptive Statistics
Summary Statistics: Basic statistics like mean, median, and standard deviation are calculated to understand the distribution of scores.

## 2. Visualizations
__Histograms and Boxplots:__ Used to visualize the distribution of scores and identify outliers.

__Correlation Heatmaps:__ Created using Seaborn to understand relationships between different variables.Pie charts for understanding proportions.

## 3. Insights and Interpretations
__Trend Analysis:__ Analyzing trends in student performance over time or across different groups.

__Comparative Analysis:__ Comparing scores based on different categories like gender, class, or subject.

# Conclusion 
This student scores analysis project provided valuable insights into the factors influencing academic performance of students.
We analyzed that in which tests students have highest and lowest average scores depending upon their gender,study hours,sports related activities.
